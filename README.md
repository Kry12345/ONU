The purpose of this project was to entertain the user in simple way. 
The goal of the game is to get rid of all the cards in your hand
The deck of cards includes:
- 10 red cards each with a unique number from 0-9 inclusive
- 10 green cards each with a unique number from 0-9 inclusive
- 10 yellow cards each with a unique number from 0-9 inclusive
- 10 blue cards each with a unique number from 0-9 inclusive
- 4 wild cards

The game starts with a card in the middle. It is determined randomly whether the user or the bot goes first
The cards that you can place in the middle depends on the card in the middle
The only cards that can be placed must be matching colors or numbers.
Wild cards can be placed anytime, and you will have a choice to set the color of the card (no number is assigned to it)

Good luck and have fun!
